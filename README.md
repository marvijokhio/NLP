# NLP
A system that can automatically classify data on its privacy level using machine learning and a rule-based expert system (CLIPS). The privacy level was determined by considering content, context, and user-based information about the data being classified. The machine learning model was designed to identify PIIâ€™s in SQL queries and data fetched whereas context and user-based constraints were handled using rules (based on organization policy). Technologies used: Python, CLIPS, Synthia health database, PostgreSQL. ML libraries used: SciKit learn, NumPy, Pandas, Beautiful Soup.
